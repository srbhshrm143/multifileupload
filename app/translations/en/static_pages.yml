        Iâ€™ve been fortunate enough to be surrounded by truly breathtaking tech
        talent living in San Francisco. This place is a melting pot full of
        diverse, intelligent, and entrepreneurial innovators who continue to
        push how we engage with the world we live in. The ideas,
        problem-solving, disruption and execution of these ideas into real
        products, services and ecosystems has made Silicon Valley the tech hub
        of the modern world.

              answer: >-
                Anyone can see the questions and answers posted by community
                members, but for posting a question or answering one, you need to
                register first. All we want from you is a valid email address, a
                password, and a username.
            q2:
              question: What is upvote and how to use it
              answer: >-
                If you find a question or answer interesting and you think that it
                adds value to the conversation, you can signal your interest or
                approval by upvoting it. You can upvote questions and answers
                separately. Answers that get the most votes appear first. Upvote
                is always a somewhat subjective category, but here are our
                recommendations - Upvote a question if you feel it is particularly
                useful, for example because you have also encountered a similar
                issue. You can also praise a question for identifying a problem
                very clearly. Upvote an answer if you think it provides a useful
                explanation for the question. We suggest upvoting answers that
                have one or more of the following qualities Precise Detailed
                Educative Well-written
