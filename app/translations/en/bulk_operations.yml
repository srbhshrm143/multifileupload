            In order to upload products to the system, you need to upload CSV that follows the specific format. Please use the export feature to obtain the valid file. You can use excel to modify the exported file to make changes to your inventory. You can use the import feature to create new products and update existing ones. The SKU will be used to identify whether a product is a new or existing one.

            The import flow goes through to the maker/checker process, which means that every request to import items needs to be explicitly approved by the Administrator.

            Below you can see a list of the headers and an explanation of what they do.

          description: >
            Data Import supports both standalone products and variants. Each variant has to be inserted as a row. Our system will use `product_uuid` column to group variants into items. Currently, all variants share names, descriptions, and photos and those values are expected to be the same across all rows.
            You can add up to three different attribute names in the CSV. Here is the list of all available attribute names along with their values. If you would like to use an attribute or a value that is not listed, please <a href="/contact-us" target=_blank>Contact Us</a>.
