# platformOS Payments Stripe

A module for processing payments in platformOS using the Stripe Payment Gateway. To use the platformOS Payments Strip module, you have to have the [platformOS Payments](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments) module installed.  

# Installation

## Installation through the Partner Portal
1. Go to the [Module Marketplace](https://portal.apps.near-me.com/module_marketplace) and click on "Buy" (it's FREE) next to the "PlatformOS Payments" and "PlatformOS Payments Stripe" modules.
2. Go to your Instance view and install both modules. 
3. During the installation process, set up Stripe public and secret keys.
4. Make sure that `enable_sms_and_api_workflow_alerts_on_staging` in your Instance configuration is set to `true`.

## Manual installation

1. Open a terminal and go to the root directory of your Instance codebase. 
2. Install the platformOS Payment Module from our GitHub repository:
  ```
  git submodule add https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments modules/payments
  ```
3. Install the platformOS Stripe Module from our GitHub repository:
  ```
  git submodule add https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments-stripe modules/stripe
  ```
4. Edit `modules/stripe/template-values.json` and *set Stripe public and secret keys*
5. Deploy Instance.
6. Make sure that `enable_sms_and_api_workflow_alerts_on_staging` in your Instance configuration is set to `true`.

# Contribution

In the next paragraph, you will find the description of all actions already predefined in the module. In case you need to use any other Stripe API endpoint that has not yet been defined, please create an Issue or Pull Request.

## Adding new Request Type

Follow these steps to add a new Request Type:

1. Determine the URL and request attributes for the desired [Stripe API](https://stripe.com/docs/api)] call.
2. Create a new file in the `modules/stripe/public/notifications/api_call_notifications/[request_type].liquid` directory so that its name matches with the `request_type` e.g. the `create_payment` request_type will invoke `create_payment` api_call_notification.
3. Similar to other API notifications, set the Authorization header, set proper Stripe API endpoint URL as the `to` property, and pass the data stored in the `data` object to the request.
4. Create a form template for your request in `modules/stripe/public/notifications/api_call_notifications/[request_type].liquid`. Please note that this step is needed only if you want to include the form in the page and can be skipped if request_type is used only with GraphQL mutations.
5. Create `response_mapper`, and add `modules/stripe/public/views/partials/templates/[request_type].liquid`. This file defines the JSON object that is passed to the `create_customization` GraphQL mutation. Passing the `id` attribute will call the `update_customizations` query. Please make sure that the correspoding CustomModelType and FormConfiguration exists in the Payment Module (e.g. the `create_refund` request type creates the `modules/payments/refund` object with `modules/payments/create_refund_form`).

## Adding new webhook endpoint

If you need to add a new webhook endpoint:

1. On the Stripe Dashboard, select the event you wish to send. Webhook configuration should be already defined with the [migration](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments-stripe/blob/master/private/migrations/20190401101010_add_gateway_keys.liquid).
2. Stripe will send requests to the [webhook "listen" page](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments-stripe/blob/master/public/views/pages/webhooks/listen.liquid) where the payload is verified with a signature.
3. The webhook object is passed to the partial `modules/stripe/webhook_processors/[webhook_event_name]`, so you need to create it and invoke desired actions.

# Request Types

Each `request type` represents a different action propagated to the Stripe payment gateway through its [REST API](https://stripe.com/docs/api). In this paragraph, you will see what actions are available and you will learn how to configure them.

To learn how to include the payment_request_form and what the default configuration options are, please read the [platformOS Payments Module Readme](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payments#gatewayruestform-configuration)

### create_customer

The `create_customer` request stores customer details in Stripe and saves the customer token in the `modules/payments/customer` object as a `gateway_id` property that can later be used to process payment without providing Credit Card details on each purchase.
For more details please see our [Customer Example](https://github.com/mdyd-dev/platformos-payment-examples/tree/master/modules/customer_example/public).

For more information see the [Stripe Customer API Example](https://stripe.com/docs/api/customers/create).
